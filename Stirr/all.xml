    <title>Walk-Ins Welcome with Bridget Phetasy</title>
    <desc>Zack Arnold, film &amp; TV editor as well as a career strategist, coach, and the founder of Optimize Yourself, sits down with Bridget for a conversation about being in the trenches in Hollywood for over 20 years, the writers' and actors' strikes, and the piece nobody is talking about - the fact that our entire culture is going through a major identity crisis because our collective sense of self is intertwined with what we do for a living. They discuss how were conditioned to believe that our identity is associated with our level of productivity, whether content creation is still a viable way to make a living, the rise of the generalists and how we need to diversify, how everything feels broken, the one thing AI cannot replicate, the value of authenticity, and why if authenticity is a strategy its not authentic. They also cover the burden of being a provider, protecting your sense of self and sense of authenticity at all costs, the mental exercise of reframing the fear and being able to confront and control that fear, redefining success and failure, changing your systems to achieve small goals, and why his willingness to fail faster than everyone else is the secret to his success.	</desc>
